# HMP-Evaluation-Framework  

Tools for evaluating accuracy and realism in human motion prediction models, with reproducible protocols.  

## About  
This repository is dedicated to the implementation of an innovative evaluation framework for Human Motion Prediction (HMP) models. Our framework introduces novel metrics and visualization tools to foster consistent and reliable model assessments, as detailed in our paper:  
**"Evaluating Human Motion Prediction: A Framework for Accuracy and Realism."**

## Availability  
The code and related materials will be made publicly available once the paper is accepted for publication.  
Stay tuned for updates, and thank you for your interest in our work!
