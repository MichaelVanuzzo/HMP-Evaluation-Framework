# HMP-Evaluation-Framework  

Tools for evaluating the accuracy and realism of Human Motion Prediction (HMP) models, with reproducible protocols.  

## About  
This repository is dedicated to the implementation of an evaluation framework for Human Motion Prediction (HMP) models.  
The framework introduces novel metrics and visualization tools to foster consistent and reliable model assessment, as detailed in our paper:  
**"Evaluating Human Motion Prediction: A Framework for Accuracy and Realism."**

## Availability  
The code and related materials will be made publicly available once the paper is accepted for publication.  
Stay tuned for updates, and thank you for your interest in our work!
